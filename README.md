  19 with a whole lot of nothing going on. i like animals and music and taking big licks of my oversized lollipop
</p>
<p align="center">
  as for ponytown, don't be afraid of me! my only ask is to have common decency. too many people are cruel online.
</p>
<p align="center">
  some basic stuffs: i do art! digital/traditional and clay sculpting! i'm also physically disabled + audhd. keep these in mind when interacting with me longterm. i'm not always available due to simply feeling Awful (i am so sorry) i promise i am not quiet nor shy, just doing something else probably!
</p>
<p align="center">
  i have many interests, but most of them focus on art. majority of my attention is focused on ocs, but outside of that, i love exploring symbolism in art, character thought processes, and animated movies as a whole :) ᶦ ᵃˡˢᵒ ˡᶦᵏᵉ ᶜᵃʳ ˢᵉᵃᵗ ʰᵉᵃᵈʳᵉˢᵗ. ᶦ ʷᵒⁿᵈᵉʳ ᶦᶠ ᵃⁿʸᵒⁿᵉ ᵖᶦᶜᵏᵉᵈ ᵘᵖ ᵒⁿ ᵗʰᵃᵗᵎ as for less involved interests, i enjoy circus works, mundane chore-oriented games, and psychology. 
  </p>

  <h6 align="center">
  but please god talk to me about animated movies..... where are the animated movie fans on here? you all should watch the breadwinner from cartoon saloon. or paranorman from laika. or robots from bluesky. or 9 from hey what studio made 9 again? can they make something similar? Please? (focus features.. go watch it!)

  i block very easily. i play ponytown to talk to like-minded people and have fun with friends.. if we were never going to talk in the first place, it don't matter! i am sociable, but by no means do i want to be friends/interact with just anyone. though, i mainly block over 3 things:
</p>
    <h6 align="center">
      1. mean-spirited, overall vindictive or aggressive 2. profic/proship or "neutral" 3. overly sexual *often* (gooner type humor/"aesthetic"..)
      </p>
      <h6 align="center">
  if any of that bothers you, i recommend you block me.. i am not looking for altercations and i will simply just mute/block and move on. do what is healthy for you :)
